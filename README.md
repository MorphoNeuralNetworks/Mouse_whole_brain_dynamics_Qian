# Mouse whole brain dynamics

This is the code for the paper "" under consideration  

## Main Idea
We will use the single-cell scale data to refine mesoscale connectivity and simulate the resting state of mice by TVMB. Specifically we will include the following goals:  
1. Realize a process from single-cell morphology data and bouton location to mesoscale connectivity. Then explain this new connectivity make sense through simulation.

2. Analyze the simulation difference between the networks constructed using s-type or c-type.

3. Compare the differences in simulation under different perturbation on neuron morphology.
